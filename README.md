# F3_WORK
This is a collection of scripts I wrote for F3 Technology Partners for the purpose of parsing the large amounts of data files they had to work with into manageable, comprehensive, and usable data files. These scripts were all written in Python. These scripts were written for AIX, centOS Linux, and SUSE Linux environments.
